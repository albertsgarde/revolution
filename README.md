# Revolution
Aid the revolution by taking ownership of resources and using them to build industry for the people!

## How to play
1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone this repo.
3. Play by editing code in `game/src/main.rs`.
4. Run with `cargo play`. This will compile and run your solution. It will tell you if you win or panic.

## Cheating
Yes, it would not be that difficult to cheat by simply changin the library code. I have deliberately not made it a fun challenge to do so.
